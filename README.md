# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating JavaScript code for analyzing the financial records of a company.

The JavaScript code should analyse the provided financial records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Combine strings and variables in the console using **concatenation**.

* Print to the nearest 100th
